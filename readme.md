## Live shoutbox via sms
You will need node.js, mongodb and working gammu-smsd for this to work, example of our working gammu config can be found from example/ directory but you will need to change it depending on your gsm/3G modem and system.

## Setup suggestion
Get a cheap laptop, install everything on it, install firefox, install r-kiosk, enable autologin and make firefox to start at boot.
Now you have a self contained live shoutbox which you can just plugin to projector.
